Top 3 most significant takeaways from the “How computers work” video

* 4 things common to all computers
  * Input 
  * Store
  * Process
  * Output

  * On Off =Bit

  * Input -modify and combine signals

# JavaScript #

JavaScript(JS)is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.
  * JS supports object oriented, imperative, and declarative (functional programming) styles.
  * JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages like displaying timely content updates,    interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
  * Three layers that build on top of each other are HTML, then CSS, then JS code.

Core client-side JavaScript language consists of some common programming features
	* Store useful values inside variables.
	* Operate on pieces of text (“strings”) 
	* Run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.
	* (APIs) Application Programming Interfaces

APIs
* APIs are ready made sets for code building blocks that allow a developer to implement programs that would otherwise be hard to implement. 

Two types of APIs
 * Browser APIs -built into web browser and expose data from the computer environment or do useful complex things. 
  * Examples:
    * DOM (Document Object Model) API -can manipulate HTML and	 CCS and apply new styles, etc. (Pop up window, new content displayed)
    * Geolocation API -retrieves geographical info (Google Maps)
    * Canvas / WebGL APIs -create animated 2D/3D graphics
    * Audio/Video APIs -play audio and video in web page or grab video from your web camera and display on someone else’s computer.
* Third Party APIs -not built into browser and have to grab their code/information from somewhere on the Web. (Typically more advanced)
	* Examples: 
		* Twitter API
		* Google Maps

* Term -”function” is a reusable code block
* Term - Interpreted code -(top to bottom; code immediately returned) JS interpreted (compilation happens at run time rather than ahead of time.
* Term - Compiled code/language -must be transformed or compiled into another form before running. (ex. C/C++) 
* Term -Just in Time Compiling - JS source code gets compiled into faster, binary format while the script is being used so it will run faster.
* Term - Text String is a text value and are written in double or single quotes. Numbers do not need quotes.  Putting a number in quotes will treat it as a text string.

* Server-side v. Client-side code
  * Server side - code that is run on the server (results are downloaded and displayed by browser) ex. PHP, Python, Ruby. ASP.NET, JS
  * Client side - code that is run on the user’s machine (downloaded, run, and displayed by browser

Dynamic v. Static code
  * Dynamic - client-side JS and server side languages. Updates display app/page showing different things in different circumstances and generating new content.  Sever-side dynamically generates new content on the server and then displays the table in a web page shown to the user.
  * Static - shows the same content all the time.

Variables
	* Containers for storing data (values).
	* Can be denoted with   var  keyword
	* Identified w/ unique names called Identifiers
	* Creating a variable is called Declaring.  Use var carName = “Volvo”;
	* Output value with id=“demo”
	* Declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
  * Declare many variables in one statement by separating with a comma and can span multiple lines
  * Variables with no value are Undefined
  * Arithmetic: var x = 5 + 2 + 3;      var x = “John” + “ ” + “Doe”;

Identifiers (are case sensitive)
	* Names must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z)
  * Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  * Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  * Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

Assignment Operator
	* The equal sign is an assignment operator and NOT an “equal to” operator.
	* The “equal to” operator is written w/ two equal signs.
